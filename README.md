# Health Dashboard in Vue 3

This app was created as a Vue 2 / Vue 3 experiment. I made exactly the same app using both version of the framework in July 2020.

It's worth mentioning that during writing of this app, I was not able to use TypeScript and decided to leave Vuex out of scope of this app.
